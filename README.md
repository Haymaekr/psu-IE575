# Introduction
With the development of blockchain technology and the digital economy, an eased number of investors are entering the cryptocurrency market nowadays. Although cryptocurrency could bring high profits with a careful investment plan and schedule, most investors still have many considerations with it because cryptocurrency prices are more volatile than others and the market still lacks restrictions. Considering this fact, metrics and indicators of the cryptocurrency market are becoming increasingly important for investors to make decisions. 

# Problem Statement
We propose to use different metrics and technical indicators on 3 distinct types of cryptocurrencies’ historical daily prices. By processing the data obtained using the API (Application Programming Interface), the values of metrics including Standard Deviation and Variance, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Simple Moving Average (SMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), OHLC, Rate of Change (ROC), Bollinger Bands (BB), Moving Avg Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is a momentum indicator, are applied respectively. Then we apply them in bidirectional LSTM model for predicting cryptocurrencies’ prices, visualize and interpret the metrics to see what kind of suggestions or inferences we could make based on them. We will try to create a dashboard for the metrics by using Streamlit.
